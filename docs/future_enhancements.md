# Future Enhancements

## 1. Choose a Deployment Platform:

### Vercel:

- **Pros:** Vercel is the creator of Next.js, providing seamless integration and support for features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and serverless functions. It offers automatic deployments, custom domains, and environment variables.
- **Cons:** Limited to the features and configurations provided by Vercel, but generally very flexible.

### AWS S3 + CloudFront:

- **Pros:** Highly scalable and customizable. AWS offers a robust set of tools for deploying and managing web applications.
- **Cons:** More complex setup and management compared to Vercel or Netlify.

## 2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

- **Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline:** Use a service like GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes. This ensures that the app is tested and deployed automatically whenever changes are pushed.
- **Benefits:** Automated testing and deployment reduce the risk of human error and ensure that every change is validated and deployed consistently.

## 3. Monitoring and Logging:

- **Monitoring Tools:** Implement monitoring tools like Datadog RUM to track errors and user interactions in production. Synthetics tests to monitor application health can be setup as well.
- **Logging:** Set up server-side logging (if applicable) to capture errors and performance metrics. Datadog RUM can be used for logging purposes as well.

## 4. Testing Strategy:

- **Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure individual components function correctly. Aim for high test coverage of critical application logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Add integration tests to verify that different parts of the application work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Consider implementing E2E tests with tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate real user interactions.
- **Test Automation:** Include tests in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run before deployment.

## 5. Documentation:

- **Contributing Guide:** Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file when multiple developers contribute to the product to establish coding standards, pull request procedures, and development workflows.

## 6. Smaller screen view:

The current table view can be enhanced to convert the tabular view to list view to support smaller screen sizes better.
